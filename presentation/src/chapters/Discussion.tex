    \begin{frame}{Why not significant}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Rapid adjustment of the mutation rate lead to fluctuation.
            \item The adaption scheme quickly hit the mutation rate bound, making them indifferent.
            \item The operation and other parameters not varying may not suit these function.
            \item The number of experiment is small so the statistical test may not reliable.
            \item There may be potential bug or wrong implementation I didn't notice.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{frame}{Limitation and Future Work}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Limitation
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Only tested on Non-constraints problem.
                    \item Only tested with a few parameters. (scale ratio, observe window, etc.)
                    \item Only tested with fixed crossover and mutation operator.
                \end{itemize}
            \item Future Work
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Test on constraint optimization problem like knapsack problem.
                    \item Conduct a comprehensive parameter search on threshold, scale values.
                    \item Discuss whether the extra computation worth.
