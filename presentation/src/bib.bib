@ARTICLE{Dixon1994-wm,
  title     = "Effect of rounding errors on the variable metric method",
  author    = "Dixon, L C W and Mills, D J",
  abstract  = "It has become customary to compare the performance of
               unconstrained optimization algorithms on families of extended
               symmetric test functions. In this paper, results are presented
               which indicate that the performance of the variable metric
               algorithm on such functions is greatly distorted by rounding
               errors that destroy the special nature of these functions. A
               simple method of overcoming this difficulty is demonstrated, and
               it confirms the theoretical result that the number of iterations
               required to solve such problems is independent of the dimension.",

Major concepts are illustrated with running examples, and major algorithms are illustrated by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge of GAs or genetics is assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and mathematics background is required.}

abstract = {In Metaheuristic Algorithms (MA), the balance between exploration and exploitation is a common issue considered an open research problem in the MA community. Besides its particular parameters, another way to control the Explorationâ€“Exploitation Balance in MA is by using a diversity metric (DM) as a guide. However, this procedure has two drawbacks: its computational cost and its effectiveness to represent the actual diversity of the population. This paper proposes a DM for real-coded candidate solutions. The approach utilizes surrogate hypervolumes to calculate the spatial distribution of the individuals in the population. In a comparison against five DM reported in the literature, our proposal achieves comparable results in terms of stability, sensitivity, and robustness in the presence of outliers, without significant increases in the computational cost.}
